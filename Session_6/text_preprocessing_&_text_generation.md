# Text Preprocessing and RNN Text Generation: Detailed Topics

This document explains in detail the six main topics covered in the notebook `gen_ai_4(RNN).ipynb`. Each topic includes explanations and relevant examples to help you understand the complete text preprocessing pipeline for RNN-based text generation in TensorFlow/Keras.

## 1. Text Data Loading and Preprocessing

**Explanation:**  
Before any machine learning or deep learning model can be trained on text, the raw data must be loaded and preprocessed. This step typically involves reading the text from a file, inspecting its contents, and preparing it for tokenization.

**Example:**
```python
myfile = open('/content/IndiaUS.txt','r')   # Open the text file
mytext = myfile.read()                      # Read file contents
myfile.close()                              # Close the file
print(mytext)                               # Display text
```

## 2. Tokenization and Encoding

**Explanation:**  
Tokenization is the process of converting text into individual tokens (usually words or subwords). Integer encoding then assigns a unique number to each token, which is essential for feeding text into neural networks.

**Example:**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer

mytokenizer = Tokenizer()
mytokenizer.fit_on_texts([mytext])          # Fit tokenizer on the entire text
word_index = mytokenizer.word_index         # Dictionary mapping words to integers
print(word_index)
```
*Output (partial):*
```python
{'the': 1, 'to': 2, 'in': 3, 'a': 4, ...}
```

## 3. Vocabulary and Sequence Analysis

**Explanation:**  
After tokenization, it's useful to analyze the vocabulary size (total unique tokens) and how the text is structured. This helps in deciding model parameters and in preparing the text for sequence generation.

**Example:**
```python
total_words = len(mytokenizer.word_index) + 1
print("Vocabulary size:", total_words)  # Example output: 599

lines = mytext.split('\n')              # Split text into individual lines
print(lines[:2])                        # Show first two lines
```

## 4. N-gram Sequence Generation

**Explanation:**  
For training language models, it's common to generate n-gram sequences. For each line in the text, we create sequences that incrementally add one word at a time. This teaches the model to predict the next word given a sequence.

**Example:**
```python
my_input_sequences = []

for line in lines:
    token_list = mytokenizer.texts_to_sequences([line])[0]
    for i in range(1, len(token_list)):
        n_gram_sequence = token_list[0:i+1]
        my_input_sequences.append(n_gram_sequence)

print(my_input_sequences[:3])  # Show first three n-gram sequences
```
*Output (example):*
```python
[[99, 4], [99, 4, 177], [99, 4, 177, 50], ...]
```

## 5. Padding Sequences

**Explanation:**  
Neural networks require input sequences to be of the same length. Padding adds zeros to the beginning (or end) of sequences so that all have equal length.

**Example:**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

max_seq_len = max([len(seq) for seq in my_input_sequences])
input_sequences = pad_sequences(my_input_sequences, maxlen=max_seq_len, padding='pre')
print(input_sequences.shape)  # (num_sequences, max_seq_len)
```
*Output (example):*
```python
(350, 50)  # 350 sequences, each of length 50
```

---

## 6. Preparation for Model Training

**Explanation:**  
Before model training, we split the padded sequences into features (`X`) and labels (`y`). The features are the preceding words in the sequence, and the label is the next word to predict.

**Example:**
```python
import numpy as np

X = input_sequences[:, :-1]  # All words except the last
y = input_sequences[:, -1]   # The last word is the label
y = np.array(y)

print("Features shape:", X.shape)
print("Labels shape:", y.shape)
```
*Output (example):*
```python
Features shape: (350, 49)
Labels shape: (350,)
```

**Summary**  
This workflow is the foundation for preparing textual data for RNN-based language models and text generation tasks. Understanding each step ensures that your models have high-quality data and are structured correctly for training and prediction.
